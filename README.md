This is the movie showcase library solely made on javascript and jquery

I have used the OMDB API for getting the movies from IMDB database. 
For more you can access omdb apply from here: http://www.omdbapi.com/

Also for making Ajax call I have used the Axios package to get sync results.
This website is purely made on cases, html and JS/javascript
